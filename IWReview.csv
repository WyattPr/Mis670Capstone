 #MINDBLOWN
 ... witnessing the selfless struggle of it all unfolding has both the necessary epic feel of a summer blockbuster infused with all the heart fans have come to expect from Marvel - 'nuff said.
 ...a business play forcing us to make yet another down payment on our collective Marvel mortgage.
" ...as much a fantastic amusement park ride as a cinematic experience, with an engaging cast doing an incredible job of not getting lost in the proceedings. "
" [Chris] Pratt jumps from blustery to goofy to vulnerable to insecure to funny with ease, as he trades barbs with Thor and his own sidekicks. Dude has charisma to spare. "
 [Infinity War] delivers on its promises without exceeding itself and also drops various surprises to various characters that we have seen grow throughout the last decade. [Full Review in Spanish]
" [Spoiler-free review:] Marvel's superhero movies may not run the risk of being called 'elegant,' but they're sure as hell sturdy, well-built popcorn flicks that send audiences out unequivocally satisfied."
 A celebration of mediocrity on a scale the cinema has never seen before. Avengers: Infinity War isn't a movie: it's advertising and brand management
 A disenchanting rain of colors that spans 150 minutes that will continue for years to come. [Full review in Spanish]
 A film ten years in the making whose only obstacle is its own success.
 A film that's overlong and overstuffed but somehow avoids being a chore to watch.
" A glorious, shocking, edge-of-the-seat adventure that boasts one of Marvel's best-ever villains ... perfectly played by Brolin and mesmerising from the first frame until the last."
" A totally different beast: darker, riskier, and more brutal. [Full review in Spanish]"
" After 2.5 hours of watching superheroes battle dark forces, I'm exhausted. And elated."
" After seeing Infinity War, I wasn't sure if I'd see it again but after thinking about it a bit longer, I do feel I could get more out of a second viewing."
" After uneven start, ""Infinity War"" finishes with a bang."
" All I know is that Marvel has lived up to its reputation for daring its filmmakers to break boundaries, and trusting its audience to go along for the ride. I don't think fans will be disappointed."
" All-all-all, Infinity War is a film that surpasses most superhero films in terms of vision, scale, grandeur and execution."
" Although I know that I disliked Avengers: Infinity War long before it arrived at its long-overdue climax, that sequence is the part that I disliked the most."
" An adrenaline rush of a film laced with bombastic action, thrilling setpieces and a level of satisfaction that's the cumulation of a decade-long journey."
 An impressive feat simply because of the discipline and skill required to deliver so much in such a comparatively tight package.
" As expected, Avengers: Infinity War has one of the most sensational and complicated group of action scenes in the MCU so far. This is, after all, the big fight. "
" As it is, everything feels like a bait and switch."
 Avengers: Infinity War changes everything... maybe.
 Avengers: Infinity War does the impossible. It tops all previous 19 Marvel movies while continuing to redefine the action genre. 
" Avengers: Infinity War is almost unwieldy, but as always, the strength of this deep cast and their ability to balance serious stakes and snarky humor gets it right."
 Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. 
" Avengers: Infinity War is everything you wanted and more - it's the end of the beginning of the end, an ambitious spectacle that confidently juggles character moments between the most epic action Marvel has ever attempted."
" Avengers: Infinity War is more than just a great superhero movie. The emotional impact on the audience, the artistry, and the brilliant storytelling are so astonishingly good, that it is simply a great film. Period."
" AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is nearly spread too thin by its massive amount of plot and characters. It redeems itself by being full of surprises and foreboding; focusing on the heroes' relationships and real peril in fierce, unrestrained action."
" Avengers: Infinity War is relentless action and entertainment, packed with super-heroes, super-heroines, superpowers and a super cliffhanger."
" Avengers: Infinity War isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be."
 Avengers: Infinity War knows what it wants to be and goes about pursuing that goal with relentless intensity.
" Be prepared to sweat, cry, and clench your armrest because Avengers: Infinity War is one hell of a ride."
" Because so much is purposefully unresolved and so little is actually decided, I just can't say I enjoyed watching Infinity War all that much."
" Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, in places both old and new, we get to witness some of the most beautiful and awe inspiring images the directors (and the entire MCU) have delivered to date."
" But on the whole, Infinity War is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that pits all of the good guys against the ultimate big bad for all of the marbles in the universe. "
 But that all goes to show that Infinity War is the kind of film that reels you in and you become emotionally invested. I'll definitely be watching again.
" By the time Infinity War draws to its enigmatic whopper of a close, even viewers feeling burned out by the guys-in-long-underwear genre will find themselves eager for the sequel. Is it next summer yet?"
" Clocking in at more than two-and-a-half hours, Infinity War never drags. Having multiple characters and storylines to cut back and forth between helps build a sense of pace."
" Despite its weak book end, ""Infinity War"" is a great adaptation and stellar crossover..."
" Easily the best Marvel movie ever made, this is also shaping up to be one of the great blockbusters of the 21st-century."
" Enjoyable but empty, Avengers: Infinity War embodies the humdrum side of the MCU. "
 'Epic' doesn't even begin to describe this mind-exploding spectacle.
" Epic in scope and a stunning achievement in blockbuster cinema, Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling superhero extravaganza that will make you laugh, gasp and cry."
" Equal parts exciting and exhausting, the film's resonant emotional crux and solid supervillain are unfortunately outweighed by an overwhelming amount of ambition and scope."
" Everyone shows up in this film, there is not a single weak performance to speak of."
" Expect to be mightily entertained by this offering that expertly mixes action and comedy before segueing into something that sort of reaches for Shakespearean levels. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
" Expectations surpassed. An ambitious, exhilarating and deeply satisfying culmination to a decade of great Marvel films. Thanos now reigns as the best villain of the MCU. Period. [Full review in Spanish]"
" Fans will likely find Infinity War satisfactory. As narrative filmmaking, however, it's a disaster: a bloated monstrosity that smothers to death its most intriguing aspects."
" Feels more like several movies squished together like a cinematic panini. Still, it's easy to be swept along by Banner's Hulkus Interruptus condition that frustrates him mightily."
" For a movie with dozens of superheroes battling in half a dozen war-torn worlds, Marvel's penultimate epic is remarkably orderly."
" For all the blockbuster spectacle on display, the film ends up in a place that's unexpectedly poetic and poignant, proving that even a movie of this size still has the ability to surprise - and more to the point: tell a good story."
" For critics who have spent much of the 21st century sniffing at the rise of the Marvel Comics Universe, it is probably time to admit that when the films are this good, they deserve every last beaming member of their audience."
" For Marvel fans preparing to see the grim, thrilling ""Avengers: Infinity War"" for the first time, only one piece of advice will do: brace yourselves."
" For those less schooled in all the backstories, Infinity War scatterguns enough laughs, thrilling digital effects and exhilarating chaos to compensate for any confusion."
" Given that the plot motor is Thanos's worry that the universe is overpopulated, sly self-awareness is shown as the filmmakers embrace drastic solutions to the problems of braiding multiple franchises into one."
" Hail, hail --- the gang's all here! ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is totally thrilling, hilarious and vastly entertaining!"
 Has twists that keep you hooked and make you gasp. The MCU will never be the same again. 
" How does art land in the world? Genre filmmaking at its best provides topical spark, often beyond the will of its creators."
 I had a lot of fun with the action and amusing banter and did not mind being inundated with CGI or the 2+ hour run time.
" If Infinity War were the Second World War, I'd go all Churchill and declare that this is not even the beginning of the end. But it is definitely the end of the beginning."
" If some pacing issues and the occasional bloat prevent it from quite reaching the upper echelons of the MCU, there's still more than enough here to keep viewers sated, saturated, and salivating over what's certain to be a poignant and potent Part Deux."
" If the Marvel Cinematic Universe aims to reshape popular entertainment, it needs to move beyond climax after climax with unremarkable, repetitive violence."
" If you thought Marvel was flagging after ten years of relentless action, Infinity War Part 1 suggests they haven't even got started."
" If you've felt we're nearing superhero exhaustion, Marvel just went and changed the rules leaving you begging for more - proving yet again that they are the real masters of this game."
" I'm breaking my rating scale for this one as this is the kind of crazy ambitious film that should be impossible to make this captivating, spectacular and memorable. "
" In some sense, this is every Marvel movie combined. So if the first installment of the two-part culmination of all that effort seems a bit loaded, I'd say other critics need to put their nitpicky hats away. This is for the fans, and they have earned it. "
" Infinity War certainly isn't totally perfect, but it's a damn fun time that rises to its challenge."
 Infinity War contains just about everybody...as if the sheer volume of Marvel characters would give the movie dramatic force. The opposite occurs.
 Infinity War feels about as emotionally empty as a child slamming action figures together.
" Infinity War gets by with a witty first hour and the starry appeal of the cast, but the gears really grind near the finish."
" Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else."
" Infinity War is a dark and satisfying superhero flick, full of death, if you're into that sort of thing."
" Infinity War is a treat, and a welcome addition to the now-decade-old Avengers series. Already, we can't wait for the next one."
" Infinity War is an achievement unparalleled in movie history, the culmination of 10 years, 19 movies and comic book stories going back to 1941 when Captain America was originally created by Jack Kirby."
 Infinity War is going to please most people. It has some very shocking elements and a few disappointing elements...but this is a blast of a Marvel movie.
" Infinity War is so gargantuan in scope, it almost becomes too much to digest. The smaller moments that have made the Marvel Cinematic Universe so enjoyable are lost in the spectacle. "
" Infinity War is, in short, an astonishing and impossible achievement. "
 Infinity War jumps from one incredible sequence to the next with dazzling ease and speed. Each leap brings a new level of entertainment and intensifies the emotional core of the story. [Full Review in Spanish]
" Infinity War's place in the Avengers saga is much like that of the middle chapters in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars: It's chief purpose is to leave you hungry for next summer's finale. And that much, it does. "
" Intense violence, strong messages in shocking Marvel epic. "
" Intriguing, but virtually devoid of suspense. Funny, but pressing too hard for laughs. Monotonous, but not boring...Still, the ambitious Infinity War should be mandatory viewing for serious Marvel movie fans."
" It is a bold undertaking, to readjust what is expected of the MCU/Avengers formula, and there are moments when the sheer scale and momentum match the narrative ambition"
" It is a massive spectacle full of fun character moments, impressive action sequences and a real sense of stakes."
" It lifts, inspires and stings in a raw way that studio blockbusters rarely manage."
" It somehow meets every single impossible expectation you have for it. To be fair, it's only because you're stupid."
" It's a little unwieldy, there are slow patches and the odd misstep, there are so many characters that your favourite might feel hard done by, and it is definitely Part 1... but the fact is that Infinity War is pretty damn thrilling."
" It's a long but slight, expansive but restricted, and busy but straightforward contradiction of a movie."
" It's a rollercoaster ride that leaves you breathless, invested and eventually panting for more. Marvel's Cinematic Universe really is something to savour and hold up as special."
 It's an infinity all right. The definition of overkill. 
" It's crowded, busy and noisy--and if you're a Marvel fan, pretty close to heaven. "
" It's effective at being all the things it needs to be, even if that necessity is the thing that holds it back the most. "
" It's fine, but you wonder how they can expect you to care about an earth-shattering conclusion when the previous two hours (and 18 movies) were all about these magic stones that can undo anything."
 It's freakishly big. It encompasses dozens of characters. It has a million moving parts. So the good news about Avengers is that this culmination of a 10-year story loop is relatively coherent.
" It's intended to knock your socks off and, in the end, it finally attains a stirring, if slightly morose, grandeur."
" It's ironic that one of Marvel's darkest films is also one of its most fun, with the character banter and personality clashes that have made so many Marvel movies memorable in full abundance."
" It's not exactly a crowded mess, but a tricky ending to this mad, mad, mad universe -- complete with all the requisite players -- will keep 'em coming back for more. "
" It's stunning to realize that their attempts to do so are the most emotionally affecting things in the whole of the perfectly-named Infinity War: people valiantly, desperately trying to evoke humanity in the midst of a machine that makes that impossible."
" It's the epitome of a summer blockbuster. The explosive action is practically nonstop, breaking only occasionally for jokes and a touch of romance - though without ever breaking its grim, apocalyptic tone."
" It's the sense that everything has been building to this moment and now, as the fun truly begins, there's nothing left to do but sit back and revel in the spectacle of it all."
" It's true that darkness permeates Avengers: Infinity War, but it's also a masterfully crafted popcorn movie."
" Love or loathe the genre, when I see a film this ambitious actually hitting its targets AND managing to stay human and accessible, I can't help but be extraordinarily impressed."
 Marvel betrays the richness of its comic books in pursuit of the bedazzlement of the modern blockbuster movie; leaving us undernourished but entertained.
" Maybe the quips and the punch-ups are there because they have to be, what with the film's steady parade of failure and even death. Plans fail. Character fails. Even sacrifices fail. It's not exactly refreshing, but it is bracing, and even gratifying. "
 My default feeling throughout was numbness bordering on fatigue.
" Never has the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War-the title is almost too apt-is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been. "
 Nothing is solved as fighters on both sides die and that's the end of the story. ...So what's left? 
" On the surface Avengers: Infinity War feels like the usual winning formula. But as the film unfolds you realise it is a monumental undertaking, gradually emerging as the War And Peace of superhero movies."
" One has to treat the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movies as a season finale, or at least the first part of a season finale. It's not really a movie in its own right. "
" Only now could the MCU arrive at a place where bluffs can be irrefutably called and gauntlets, real or metaphorical, can be thrown down. With audacity and thoughtfulness, ""Infinity War"" upends the comparative breeziness of all that came before it."
" Our superheroes are on the tightrope, but in the end, they are a group of extraordinary people who will fight the battle that we cannot fight. [Full review in Spanish]"
" Over the last decade, the Marvel movies have shown us they can be more - weirder, funnier, more eccentric, even more politically loaded than simple adventure stories. This one feels like a step backward."
" Overstuffed but underwhelming, 'Infinity War' is burdened with too many characters, too many battles, and an ending that is meant to shock but is obviously a cheap trick."
" Relentless, entertaining and more than a touch surprising, yet starved of substance and likely to leave many feeling shortchanged."
" Roaring through 160 minutes of action, humor, character development, epic evil and moving nobility, it is darker and edgier, yet lighter and more stirring than anything offered in another superhero franchise."
" Slightly above average for an MCU movie, though more of a triumph of continuity than of entertainment or filmmaking."
" So much happens, getting bored is physically impossible. [Full Review in Spanish] "
" Some characters were used well, others were in support, and then some were just there because the contract said so...there's a lot happening, a lot of jumping around...but a decade of set up for an epic buildup I personally loved."
" Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early."
" Somehow nearly every story that's been started in this cinematic universe gets serviced. That's no small feat for a series that centers on more than a dozen different characters, and yet still manages to make every one of them count. "
" Stunning action sequences, especially the climactic battle that rivals the immense Battle of Helms Deep in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers."
" Ten years of Marvel superheroism culminates in a battle for the universe itself. Exhausting, bitterly humorous, and gripped in a stunning finality, it's almost too much to take in, yet somehow not enough."
" Thankfully, this $300 million entry into the Marvel comic-book movie universe is one of the better films pumped out by Marvel Studios and certainly makes up for the tornado of dung that was Avengers: Age of Ultron."
" Thanks to Thanos, Infinity War is much more than a two-part blockbuster, and for the first time in a long time, we can't easily anticipate more of the same, because the road ahead for superheroes is murky, complicated, and terrifying."
" Thanos is an idiot, but neither he nor the filmmakers know this."
 Thanos is given tremendous emotional depth and development but the rest of the vast superhero pantheon appear to have been given two hours of busy work.
" Thanos packs a heck of a punch in ""Infinity War"" - he pretty much punches everyone. It's the emotion behind those punches that will surprise you."
 The [Russo] brothers clearly know what clicks and to keep things moving.
" The Avengers: Infinity War isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema."
" The best Marvel film ever-the most complete, the most emotional, and the most thrilling."
" The commotion of an ending will leave the public anxious for the next chapter, but Infinity War does tell a whole story by itself. [Full review in Spanish]"
" The equivalent of a bad one-night stand with a very weak climax that you wish would've ended much, much sooner."
 The fact is that in Infinity War... everyone has their moment and meshes perfectly with the whole. [Full review in Spanish]
" The film plays like an ""event book"" reads"
 The final moments of Infinity War are haunting and impactful and mysterious.
 The flavors of this multi-movie sundae blend beautifully.
" The high doesn't last, but it's dizzying all the same."
" The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
" The mood shifts from one-liners to kitchen sink drama to downright bleak throughout, without ever jarring greatly. Surprise is the Russo's main weapon here. We never know what's coming next."
" The movie equivalent of a theme park ride. Has highs, lows, excitement and an ending to make sure you wanna go on it again... after you've regained your breath. [Full review in Spanish]"
" The movie is packed with fun banter and set pieces, but it's not really about anything, and the ending falls flat."
 The outcome satisfyingly tops the trip and resonates long after you leave the theater. [Full Review in Spanish]
" The reported budget of about $300 million should, in all likelihood, look like a bargain when the final returns are tallied. "
" The Russo Brothers have confectioned a film whose frenetic pacing can fatigue Marvel skeptics, but will cause joyous anxiety for loyal fans. [Full Review in Spanish]"
" The Russos, while tipping their hat to these individual filmmakers who put their unique stamp on each of their own films, elevate their own art and skilfully weave a story that seems cohesive and resonant, physically and emotionally."
" The scope of the movie is massive. Yet, it feels intimate because, through the previous Marvel movies, we have become emotionally invested in many of these characters."
 The stakes have never been higher with the release of Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War.
" There are some decent laughs before things turn serious, and the deft timing that has always been one of the sneakier pleasures of this multi-chapter behemoth is in evidence as heroes collide in attitude and physique."
" There is a fissure between critics and audiences, which I can admit. The movie is critic-proof. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is superhero porn, strictly for the fans, while 'Black Panther' was undeniably excellent, transcending the comic book fan base."
" There is whip-smart warfront humor to lighten the mood but, most importantly, in bleak times on and off the screen, they give us something vital: hope."
" There's a lot going on in Infinity War, including actual suffering, sacrifice and real emotions, most of which won't sink in until the end credits roll."
 There's a lot to meditate on in this breathlessly told comic book adventure film.
" There's just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story."
 There's just too much of this thing.
" This blockbuster leaves you wildly curious about the sequel, even if you are not an Avengers fanatic. "
" This chaotic but surprisingly nimble instalment, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, brings together an eye-popping ensemble cast of A-listers (imagine the table read!) and pushes them into playful new configurations."
 This is a movie for hardcore fans... [Full review in Spanish]
" This is a movie that needs the other 18 to exist before it. Otherwise, we'd know very little about these characters, their concerns, and why we should care for them."
 This is a wildly entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions.
" This is an epic tale sheathed in spandex, a super heroic soap opera. The Russos know how to deliver the bang, but also when to lay back."
 This is Marvel doing the absolute best version of the formula it's been criticised for overusing. They've blown it right up and now need to throw out that formula for good.
" This is probably the best, if not second best, movie in the MCU...this movie makes some bold, heavy choices."
" This jumping backwards and forwards from too many plot threads sometimes dissipates the tension and over-complicates everything. Fortunately, the contractually-impossible cast is mostly in strong form."
" This movie almost, but not quite seamlessly, brings together the disparate strands of a decade's worth of Marvel/Disney movies."
 This movie isn't actually about the Avengers. It's about Thanos. 
" Too long, too dark, too confusing - and it should state up front it is part one of a ""to be continued"" movie. The humor helps you endure the overrunning length. "
 Watching Infinity War is like riding the most exhausting Six Flags roller coaster in existence three times consecutively
 What prevents Avengers: Infinity War from being as entertaining as some of its predecessors is that there aren't many small moments that make the explosions and CGI monsters more meaningful. 
" What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it."
" Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular..."
" While these films have been flooding the market, you've got to hand it to uber-producer Kevin Feige whose grand design comes into sharper and sharper focus."
" While this is a massive comic-book spectacle, what's most amazing is how - after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996 - Marvel, led by Kevin Feige, now dominates the global box-office."
" Yes, I want to see the next Marvel movie. But I long for popcorn movies like the last couple of Mission: Impossible installments, in which, after two-plus hours of ridiculously entertaining action, the mission actually is accomplished."
 You know all that Infinity War hype? It lives up to it. And then some.
