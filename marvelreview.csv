" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" relied too much on the audience already knowing the Marvel mythology. Call it, in my opinion, an unacceptable shorthand. "
" ""Star Wars"" for a new generation."
" ... A total blast, with a sense of adventure and mischievous fun that can make even a movie critic feel like a kid again."
 ... retro space opera plays more like a bad spoof of a 'Star Wars' spoof ‒ and even then it's closer to 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' than 'Spaceballs.'
" ...Groot easily steals the show...equal parts 'Farscape,' 'Firefly,' and the few family-friendly parts of 'Pitch Black' while putting an original spin on it."
" [It's] the first of the MCU properties that didn't feature a major Marvel character. Surprise, surprise, when you make the most enjoyable space opera romp since The Fifth Element, name recognition just doesn't matter."
 100% sugar rush Saturday matinee sci-fi junk food.
 A heck of an intergalactic romp.
 A mad act of absurd genius.
 A Marvelous sci-fi adventure that flies by in a whoosh of nimble action and colorful characters.
" A near masterpiece, and one with an amazing soundtrack."
 A piece of wit that makes it's own niche within the genre. This galactic treat is new world.
" A rollicking carnival ride halfway across the universe and back that leaves you with a big, goofy, satisfied smile when it's over."
" A vibrantly exciting, immensely entertaining and frequently hilarious sci-fi adventure."
" After a summer of slick, seamless superhero, monster and robot blockbusters, there's certainly something to be said for a movie that feels reckless and messy."
" Against all odds, the studio has yet another elegant, extremely entertaining winner on its hands."
" Although the main characters lack the depth and dimension of characters in some of the other Marvel movies, it has plenty of action and plenty of humor too. It is an enjoyable popcorn movie."
 An entire movie based on a certain wise-acre tone but without losing sight of how audiences still appreciate characters that wear their hearts on their sleeve.
" An exciting thrill-ride that strikes a brilliant balance between jaw-dropping space scenes, anarchic wit and bountiful belly laughs."
" An exhilarating delight-a tongue-in-cheek, big-budget sci-fi blockbuster that could easily be this generation's Star Wars."
" At first I thought, 'This movie isn't as clever as it thinks it is.' But after a while, I decided maybe it was after all."
" Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind."
 Bravo James Gunn; he took a lesser-known comic book and spun it into the most entertaining ride I've had all year.
" Buoyed along by snarky banter and breezy 1970s pop, this freewheeling Marvel Comics movie is a giddily entertaining sci-fi romp."
" By Friday night, anyone who has seen this first ""Guardians"" will be speaking volumes about all its future possibilities, especially big-name actors scampering to hop aboard for a potentially huge and long franchise ride."
" By playing with sci-fi and comic book clichés and assembling a charismatic and likeable cast, Guardians of the Galaxy is a welcome return to form for Marvel."
" By refusing to follow the usual formula, filmmaker James Gunn has made Marvel's best-yet movie, a summer action-adventure that provides more cinematic fun than the rest of the year's blockbusters rolled into one."
" Chris Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays the leader of the pack of misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for seventies music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects."
 Credit too must go to director James Gunn who puts his individual stamp on the film while operating within Marvel's house style.
" Director and co-writer James Gunn brings a giddiness and a wondrous, endless sense of why-the-hell-not? possibility that's reminiscent of Star Wars."
" Director James Gunn tosses together a dizzying blend of superhero bravado, outer-space adventure and off-the-wall comedy that introduces the strangest and most enjoyable bunch of rogues ever to inhabit the same spaceship."
" Eentertaining from start to finish, thanks to --- guess what? --- the writing! "
" Entertaining, clever and often quite funny."
 Fans... will delight in the wisecracks offered by Rocket (Rocky Raccoon) or the profundities of Groot. 
 Far more lively than anything in the last three Star Wars; it's far closer in the constellation to the jokey heroism of Joss Whedon's Serenity than George Lucas's New Age sky-piloting. 
" Finally, some jokey superheroes."
" Fun and fresh, Guardians Of The Galaxy is another winner from Marvel, and further proof of a very old dictum: you've got to gamble big to win big."
 Galaxy's great fun but its biggest creative gamble is featuring untested heroes. If that's cause for celebration then risk ain't what it used to be. 
" Goofy, energetic, space-faring fun."
 Guardians bounces with the energy of pure invention.
 Guardians defies Marvel's house style.
 Guardians of the Galaxy breathes new life into an otherwise stale story thanks to a great script and Gunn's crafty direction.
 Guardians of the Galaxy exists solely to advertise its own as-yet-unmade sequels.
" Guardians of the Galaxy is a total treat - funny, exciting, filled with great effects, and containing a few welcome moments of emotion. This is the Marvel movie I can see myself watching again and again. "
" Guardians of the Galaxy is a weird, risky prospect for a studio that's all about relatable humans in recognisable settings. Maybe that's why it works: faced with a tougher sell, they've gone the extra mile to make something special."
 Guardians Of The Galaxy is at its best when it's trying to be funny. You could almost describe as a spoof in places!
" Guardians Of The Galaxy is deliriously, insanely its own thing, possessed of an idiosyncratic, intimate sense of humour and a magnificently diverse cast, all of whom find exactly the right tone of low-key commitment. Everything fits."
" Guardians of the Galaxy is first-class, Grade-A space adventure comedy."
" Guardians of the Galaxy is full of what made movies fun back when Jaws and Star Wars were igniting the genre. It also may be, or at least is to date, the best Marvel comic to make it to the big screen."
 Guardians of the Galaxy is just an obscene amount of fun.
 Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel Studios' best and certainly the most punk rock.
 Guardians of the Galaxy is right up there with The Avengers as a movie that delivers all the fun and action you want from a superhero adventure.  
 Guardians of the Galaxy is the brave new world of cinema.
" Guardians of the Galaxy is the perfect summer movie, delivering exactly what you want from a comic book adaptation."
" Guardians of the Galaxy isn't just a fun-filled, laugh-filled, ripping space fantasy comedy, it's one of the best, most crowd-pleasing blockbusters in years."
" Guardians of the Galaxy joins The Avengers, Iron Man 3, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the elite tier of greatest Marvel films to date. It's not just as good as you've heard, it's better."
" Guardians of the Galaxy may be the most unique film to come out of the Marvel stable so far. If the oppressive weight of late summer has you down, this movie may be just the thing you need."
" Guardians of the Galaxy may blast off another successful franchise for Marvel, but it has a few parsecs left to go before it can truly claim greatness."
 Guardians succeeds when it proves the Marvel formula is malleable; it fails when it discovers that formula is not yet malleable enough.
 Gunn and his cast understand that the interplay among the quirky Guardians is what matters. The next Avengers movie already looks silly by comparison.
" Gunn appears to remember the high of certain kinds of moviegoing, where when the credits are over, all you want to do is get back in line and enjoy the whole thing again."
" Gunn delivers a pageant of eye candy splashed with the primary-color palette of his funnybook source material. He has the aesthetic down, if not always the mechanics."
" Gunn doesn't so much reinvent the wheel as reshape it a little, giving the rest of the vehicle a fresh lick of paint in the process."
 Gunn has done a marvelous job of character development with a large cast of unknown comic-book roles.
 Gunn has helped take a relatively unknown property and made a film that will surely help blast these incredible characters to a level of fame that will spread across the galaxy.
 Gunn keeps the action moving at a pace that's sometimes exhausting but amidst all the explosions and the crashing spaceships and exploding cityscapes there's usually room for a quick quip or laugh-out-loud gag.
" Gunn's filming of a once-thought-unfilmable project is a blast, with pleasingly fanciful FX, a soundtrack of rock classics, a streak of pleasing emotion and a large cast who are all obviously having as much fun as the audience."
" Gunn's listless adventure through space is not as uproarious as the Iron Man series, as thrilling as the Spider-Man franchise, or as dramatically serious as Nolan's Batman trilogy. "
" Haters STFU, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is cinematic nirvana..."
" Hovering between irony and sincere enthusiasm, the film is above all a triumph of tone. "
" I could watch a ""Guardians"" movie that's just the five of them sitting around a table with a pitcher of beer and a deck of cards. Hard to say that about the X-Men."
 I had more fun watching Guardians of the Galaxy than I've had in a long time.
" I think they've really created characters, James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Pearlman, and I think the screenplay is really lovely."
" If blockbusters are the cinematic equivalent of junk food, then 2014 has been a goddamn ice-cream sundae, and Guardians is the bright, sickly sweet cherry sitting on top."
" If you want a superior successor to Red Dwarf, Blake's 7, Star Wars and, yes, Scooby Doo then look no further. There are worse things."
" In proper ""who gives a toss?"" B-movie tradition, Guardians of the Galaxy takes us into the silly section of the Marvel Universe."
" It all happens about 100 times faster than the original Star Wars while taking itself about 1,000 times less seriously than the Star Wars prequels."
 It captures the breathless thrill and adolescent bemusement that comes with reading a rip-snorting and beautifully drawn 30 page comic issue.
" It may be a mess, but it's an extremely good-natured mess, full of humor and warmth. More surprising still, the very elements that seemed most likely to ruin the movie-the tree-man, the talking raccoon-account for much of its improbable charm. "
" It might ultimately break down to nothing but empty calories, but it is always full-on fun. I repeat: always."
" It takes a good hour for (director James) Gunn to find the proper blend of comedy and seriousness. Once it hits its stride, though, the movie offers undeniable pleasures and unexpected emotional heft."
 It taps into what the first three Star Wars films knew and the next three forgot: big heart and a sense of humor are what keep heavy machinery running smoothly.
 It's a summer blockbuster worthy of the moniker. 
 It's like an Assistant Editors' Month issue writ large.
 It's like watching a 'Star Wars' movie filled with nothing but Han Solos.
" It's overstuffed with effects and incident, but it looks great, it feels fresh and it's sometimes laugh-out-loud funny."
 It's the movie's rollicking good cheer that ultimately might help endear it to folks who otherwise wouldn't know the Guardians' Rocket Raccoon from The Beatles' Rocky Raccoon.
 James Gunn's first foray into big-budget movie making succeeds despite focusing on characters largely unknown to mainstream audiences and provides some of the most genuinely affecting moments of any Marvel film to date.
" Junk, and proud of it"
" Larger-than-life and dangerously explosive, they're so funny that boys and girls will love the film in equal measure."
" Like so many elements of this film, this narrative arc is all too familiar. But it's fun to watch it played out with such B-movie gusto."
" Marvel's sci-fi adventure has it all: laughs, action, charm."
" May the Farce be with you, dude. ""Star Wars"" meets ""Spaceballs."""
 Not since Han Solo and Chewbacca hit the galaxy has there been as much raucous energy and sheer fun as in this blast of a sci-fi fantasy involving a daredevil adventurer and a mysterious orb
" Once again, we get an against-the-odds, mid-air battle among exploding skyscrapers and fleeing extras. But it's beautifully realised in eye-popping 3D."
" One of the most exciting things about Guardians Of The Galaxy is that it is a departure from the Marvel feature film template. Guardians Of The Galaxy is very much a Marvel movie, but it's also (way) out there, doing its own thing."
" One of the most pleasant surprises of a mixed-bag movie summer, Guardians of the Galaxy is something akin to Star Wars on Quaaludes."
" Outre, cheerful, yes... but wake me up when the Doctor Strange movie is ready."
" Perhaps it was too much to hope for a smart, cartoony and slightly parodic space romp, instead of this, a more standard-issue Marvel superhero offering"
" Pratt is their prime asset for turning the comedy up to 11. With him playing Star-Lord, you never question what Quill brings to the team: a sparkling, cracked esprit de corps."
" Pratt's charm and presence go a long way to carry the film through a confusing first act bogged down in character introductions, back story and set-up."
" Probably the most light-hearted Marvel movie, this one pulls you in with its wacky narrative turns and keeps you engaged in a world far, far away where anything can happen."
" Rip-roaring, irreverent and so much fun, Guardians of the Galaxy succeeds in not only introducing and connecting these relatively unknown characters into the Marvel pantheon, but in making it one of the most enjoyable and unforgettable of the bunch"
 Sci-fi hasn't been this fun since Star Wars and it hasn't been this funny since Galaxy Quest.
" The audience applauded. All ages, all walks of life, got hooked on a feeling - a feeling of delight - that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' delivers."
 The best Star Wars film since 1980.
" The big-screen debut of this underdog crew of ragtag Avengers tries a little too hard to fit in with its competition, rather than stand out."
" The cast are clever at filling in the gaps the story has to carry, with the romantic attraction between Peter and Gamora, which begins with some hearty hand to hand combat, given more emotional weight than the dialogue allows for."
" The film begins to stumble, then, once the focus shifts to a narrative that's almost distractingly convoluted..."
" The lightly derisive, live-action-cartoon tone robs the movie of any majesty, even of the comic-book type, and the many violent deaths of their suitable gravity."
 The most fun film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a fine start to a new era.
 The most purely entertaining movie of the summer.
 The movie is naturally thick with CGI. But Gunn uses the digital effects to create scenes of striking beauty.
" The movie is seriously smile-worthy, largely due to the sheer number of jokes throughout."
" The plot is bonkers, and there's way too much CGI, but the core little group of disparate characters manage to latch themselves to you, and you're in."
 The post-George Lucas Star Wars sequel fans of the original trilogy have been hoping for.
 The screenplay does an exceptional job of incorporating this film into the pre-existing and percolating Marvel cinematic universe.
" The script is tossed through with entertaining banter, the action sequences are spirited and filled with inventive imagery, and the spirit of the whole enterprise is bright and energized..."
 The thing that makes Guardians of the Galaxy so wonderful is that it's completely bonkers.
" There are obvious touchstones here in Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but Gunn allows his influences to inform rather than define the film."
" There have been few must-see films of the 2014 summer season, but Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one."
" There's enough liveliness in the cast and director Gunn's brisk pacing that, at its best, the movie's energy emulates the go-for-it glee of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope."
" There's lots of action, incredible 3D, all the bells and whistles audiences expect from a tentpole film. But it's the brilliant humor that will help Guardians undoubtedly be one of the biggest hits of the year."
" There's plenty of action, of course, but it's the heart and humor, delivered consistently throughout Guardians of the Galaxy, that make this tongue-in-cheek space opera the perfect fit for the 21st Century."
" These are unfamiliar Marvel characters, on the big screen if not on the page, which together with the witty script gives the whole package a welcome freshness."
 These meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown CG sequences.
 Think a wild ride through an amusement park with five crazy friends. Or Star Wars meets Flying High. 
" Throughout this technical haze, Guardians carries forth with more spirit than anything Marvel has put out to date."
" To an extent, the film plays like a mixtape: slowly unwinding, confident in its own rhythms, unafraid to luxuriate in comic asides or hurtle forward the action."
" Wall-to-wall wisecracks notwithstanding, Gunn manages to locate a heart in the midst of the lovingly rendered comic-book chaos."
" What makes James Gunn's scruffier and un-spandex'd band of reluctant heroes so appealing is how they approximate the good-hearted rogues on the raggedy charm of space westerns like Joss Whedon's own ""Firefly""."
 What more could a kid -- or a grown-up who's seen too many overly serious superhero movies -- ask for?
 What sets this film apart from the less effective summer movies is that director James Gunn has put together a cast that can handle the action and the humor.
" When Guardians of the Galaxy is firing on all cylinders, you'll think there's nothing better in this world, or any other."
 Where it does work is in the lightness of touch director James Gunn brings to proceedings.
" Where other comic-book fare has felt like action blockbusters with sprinkles of comic relief, Gunn has been allowed to make a comedy that happens to feature comic-book characters."
" While not all superhero films are created equal, this comic-book space adventure adaptation is just good enough."
" While still suffering from a few symptoms of blockbuster-itis, Guardians feels more relaxed than your typical corporate summer tentpole. It has a puckish, sideways wit."
" With its fantastic ensemble of characters and great sense of humor (not to mention an incredible soundtrack), it rises above the standard formula to make an entertaining and thrilling ride that leaves a lasting impression."
" With the freedom afforded by the obscure source material, Gunn reminds us that blockbusters don't have to take themselves too seriously."
